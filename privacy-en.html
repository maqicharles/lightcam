        <h2>I. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>(A) Necessary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Camera permission-related information: To achieve professional-level camera functions, including the use of front and rear cameras, automatic/manual exposure adjustment, filter beautification, and high-definition video recording, we need to obtain your camera usage permission. During your use of the camera function, we only temporarily process the photo and video data you take and will not store or transmit this content without your consent, unless you actively choose to save it to the album or share it.</li>
            <li>Flashlight and warning light permission-related information: When you use the flashlight (high beam, low beam, SOS mode, etc.) and warning light (red and blue warning flashing light) functions, we need to obtain the device's flash control permission. This permission is only used to control the device's hardware lights and will not collect any personal information.</li>
            <li>Screen fill light and solid-color light permission-related information: To achieve the functions of freely selecting the color temperature and brightness of the screen fill light and the full-screen illumination and color-changing of the screen solid-color light, we need to obtain the screen display control permission. This permission is only used to adjust the screen display parameters and will not collect your personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(B) Non-essential but Experience-Enhancing Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Location information: If you choose to enable the location information permission, we can provide you with more scenario-appropriate lighting usage suggestions based on your location. For example, in an outdoor adventure scenario, we can recommend suitable warning light modes or fill light parameters for you. You can turn off this permission at any time in the device settings without affecting the use of other basic functions.</li>
            <li>Album access permission: When you choose to save the photos or videos you take to the album or select materials from the album for editing, we need to obtain the album access permission. We only access the album content with your explicit authorization and will not read or transmit other data in the album without your consent.</li>

            <li>We adopt reasonable technical and management measures to ensure the security of your personal information and prevent the information from being leaked, tampered with, or lost.
